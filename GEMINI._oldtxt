### Current Working Idea: Predictive AI via Synthetic Data Generation

This is the primary focus of the project. The goal was to implement a sophisticated AI-driven prediction and pricing engine by generating our own realistic, simulated dataset. This feature has been removed due to usability concerns.

*   **Objective:** Implement Predictive Occupancy and Dynamic Pricing features.
*   **Dataset Strategy:** Since finding a stable, real-world dataset has proven unreliable, we will create our own high-quality synthetic dataset. This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the problem domain and gives us full control over the data.
*   **Implementation Plan:**
    1.  **Data Generation:** A Python script (`ml_model/generate_data.py`) will be created to intelligently generate and populate the database with historical parking records, simulating real-world patterns like time of day, day of the week, and random events.
    2.  **AI Model Training:** A Jupyter Notebook will be used to train a time-series forecasting model (e.g., using `scikit-learn`) on our generated data. The trained model will be saved to a file.
    3.  **API Development:** A new API endpoint will be created to load the saved model and provide occupancy predictions and dynamic pricing based on those predictions.
    4.  **Frontend Integration:** The Owner Dashboard will be enhanced to visualize historical data and display the AI's predictions.

### Discussion Points

This section summarizes key strategic and technical discussions about the project's direction.

*   **Dataset Strategy:** Initial attempts to use a real-world dataset from Kaggle were unsuccessful due to unstable/broken links. We have pivoted to generating our own synthetic data, which is a robust and academically sound approach that unblocks development.
*   **AI Strategy:** The core AI feature will be time-series prediction for occupancy. We explicitly decided against computer vision to keep the project scope focused and avoid implementation complexities.
*   **Database Architecture & Security:** The current single-database approach with strong, role-based access control is secure, scalable, and aligns with industry best practices.
*   **Project Constraints:** The project must not incur any hardware or software licensing costs. All development will use free, open-source software.

### Project Development History

This is a log of the major features and bug fixes implemented to date.

1.  **Initial Setup:** Created the basic file structure and set up the Flask application.
2.  **Database Schema Redesign & Implementation:** Transitioned to a normalized, scalable SQLite database schema (`users`, `lots`, `spots`).
3.  **User Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented user registration, login, logout, and protected routes with secure password hashing and session management.
4.  **Owner Dashboard (`owner.html`):** Created a full CRUD interface for managing parking lots, including an interactive map for location selection.
5.  **Spot Management Page (`lot_spots.html`):** Built a dedicated page for owners to manage individual spots within a lot.
6.  **Customer Page (`customer.html`):** Implemented smart search, booking, and map integration.
7.  **Role Selection & Dynamic Redirection:** Created a role selection page and enforced role-based access control.
8.  **Project Portability:** Created `requirements.txt` and `README.md`.
9.  **Enhanced AI Smart Search:** Integrated Gemini API for smart search with explanations.
10. **Real-time Updates:** Integrated `Flask-SocketIO` for live spot status updates on the customer map.
11. **UI Overhaul:** Implemented a new, modern UI with a central `style.css`, a card-based design, and improved layout.
12. **Database Security & Stability:**
    *   Ensured data persistence by preventing tables from being dropped on restart.
    *   Cleaned up unused code (`models.py`).
    *   Verified and strengthened role-based access control on all routes.
13. **Bug Fixes & UX Refinements:**
    *   Fixed bugs related to initial UI state, faulty search results, and incorrect spot type options.
    *   Corrected visual glitches in the UI.
